For this specific test script.

I used Python programming language

IDE - PyCharm

Selenium tool

I write test script in one single file.

You need to copy this file and run on the pycharm where you already connected selenium with python.

Then you can copy this test script and run on the pycharm.

Then you will see the automation.
